**The Rise of Automation**

Automation isn't something new. From the dawn of man, we have used our brains to make tools, improve upon them, and make our lives easier.

In order to effectively operate you need orchestration, which currently is disparate and scattered among the variety of  open source, closed source, and specific verticals.
